# Maze-Game
This project has been developed as a university project, for a Programming and OOP course. The programming language used is Java.
As part of the project, the two students chose to learn about version control using Git and about game design. 
The main branch constitutes the final, finalised project.
The New branch was mainly used as a way of learning Git.
The StartAnew branch has been used in early stages of the project to make changes and experiment with different ideas, including learning Git.
The OneFrame branch has been used to try to make the necessary changes to put the entire game into one JFrame, however, after multiple failed attempts, the students decided to stick to what they developed until then.
OneFrame was then used to add the final changes to the project.
The project starts in the Main.java class, that is where the main function is.
